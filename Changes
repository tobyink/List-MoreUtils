0.400	2013-10-nn
    - Reformat Changes as per CPAN::Changes::Spec
    - taking FIRSTCOME power and move repository to GitHub
    - merge Tassilo's 0.25_nn dev releases back
        * mark "any" and "all" as "to be discussed"
	  ==> API changes made by Alias/ADAMK 
    - bump version to clarify new age (contributors welcome!)
    - bump minimum perl version to 5.8.3

0.33	2011-08-04
    - Updated can_xs to fix a bug in it

0.32	2011-05-20
    - Production release, no other changes

0.31_02	2011-03-21
    - More accurate detection of XS support (ADAMK)

0.31_01	2011-03-21
    - Updating copyright year (ADAMK)
    - Teak documentation of all() and none() (WYANT)
    - Memory leak fixed for apply() and XS version restored (ARC)
    - Memory leak fixed for indexes() and XS version restored (ARC)
    - Memory leak fixed for part() and XS version restored (ARC)

0.30	2010-12-16
    - Change the way we localise PERL_DL_NONLAZY to false to remove
      a warning that some people were seeing. The new approach is taken
      from the way that List::Util does it.

0.29	2010-12-08
    - Removed an erroneous Test::NoWarnings dependency

0.28	2010-12-07
    - Switching to a production release
    - Restored the regression test for RT #38630 from 0.23.
      As apply() was disabled in 0.27_04 this test will only act
      to validate the future XS restoration of apply().
    - Adding uniq warning tests, disabled initially

0.27_04	2010-12-06
    - The behaviour of any/all/none/notall has changed when
      passed a null list to treat a null list as a legitimate list.
      Instead of returning C<undef> the functions now return the
      following: any {} == false, all {} == true, none {} == true,
      notall {} == false.
      Resolves #40905: Returning undef when none is passed an empty
    - Disabled the leaking XS versions of part(), apply() and indexes()

0.27_03	2010-12-06
    - General house cleaning

0.27_02	2010-12-01
    - Reduced test suite peak memory consumption by 5-10 meg
    - Added the 'distinct' alias for the uniq function, for people that
      like their chained map/grep/sort pipelines with a SQL'ish flavour.
    - Expanded test suite for the any() group of functions.
    - The any() group of functions now strictly always return scalar
      boolean true, false and undef to match the XS version.

0.27_01 2012-12-01
    - Refactored the split test scripts into a common test module
      to be shared between both the Perl and XS versions.
    - Reapply fix for http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=39847
      "minmax error: unpredictable results with lists of 1 element"

0.26	2010-11-23
    - No changes
    - Some parts of the CPAN cloud were confusing my 0.24
      release with the older deleted 0.24. Bumping version
      past Tassilo's to clarify things.

0.24	2010-11-22
    - No changes, switching to a production version

0.23_01	2010-09-25
    - First attempt at repackaging the List::MoreUtils code in
      Makefile.PL and release toolchain similar to Params::Util

0.25_02	2009-08-01
    - MS VC++ 7 doesn't like inline nor 'long long'
      (patch provided by Taro Nishino (taro DOT nishino AT gmail.com)
    - Newx isbn't around in older perls so use New(0,...) instead

0.25_01	2009-07-30
    - it seems the only way of handling the stack that works on all 
      flavors of the multicall API is by making a shallow copy of it
      and use that between the PUSH/POP_MULTICALL bracket
    - fix awkward ok() override in List-MoreUtils.t so that it reports
      line numbers in test failures properly

0.24	2009-07-19
    - List::MoreUtils was not handling the stack properly when the stack was grown
      from inside code-references
    - a couple of tests for each_arrayref were calling each_array 

0.23	2009-04-19
    - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE:
      fixed: Returning undef when none is passed an empty array is counterintuitive
      (http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=40905)
    - fixed: minmax error: unpredictable results with lists of 1 element 
      (http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=39847)
    - fixed: bug: uniq doesn't like undef values.
	     uniq warns on undef values
      (http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=37533)
      (http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=43214)
    - fixed: bug in pairwise when $a and $b are lexically defined using my
      (http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=44518)
    - fixed: Big memory leak with XS part()
      (http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=41097)
    - fixed: memory leak in indexes() [XS]
      (http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41494)
    - reduced memory-requirements for the part() tests as that was responsible
      for a lot of unnecessary test-failures
    - new function bsearch() which performs a binary search

0.22	2006-07-02
    - SvPV_nolen doesn't exist on pre 5.6 perls

0.21	2006-06-18
    - propagate dies from inside the code-reference of pairwise to 
      caller

0.20	2006-04-25
    - part() would destroy the list elements when changing
      an array in place (@list = part { ... } @list)

0.19	2006-03-13
    - working down myself the queue of suggestions:
      part() added
      (Ricardo SIGNES <rjbs AT cpan DOT org>)

0.18	2006-02-25
    - each_arrayref (XS) couldn't deal with refs to list literals
      (brought up by David Filmer <usenet AT DavidFilmer DOT com>
       in comp.lang.perl.misc)

0.17	2005-12-07
    - each_arrayref had no XS implementation and wasn't
      mentioned in the PODs
      (patch by Anno Siegel <siegel AT zrz DOT tu-berlin DOT de>)

0.16	2005-11-14
    - a dangling semicolon in some macros prevented
      the XS portion to compile on some compilers
      (Lars Thegler <lars AT thegler DOT dk>)

0.15	2005-11-11
    - 0.13 and 0.14 broke the module on 5.6.x
      (spotted by Thomas A. Lowery <tlowery AT cc3 DOT com>)
    - internals changed to make use of the new MULTICALL API 
      which had to be backported to 5.005_x

0.14	2005-11-10
    - 0.13 fixed the leaks but rendered the XS part uncompilable
      for perls < 5.6.0: Fixed
      (spotted by Lars Thegler <lars AT thegler DOT dk>)

0.13	2005-11-09
    - nearly all functions receiving a CODE-block as first
      argument had a hefty memory-leak: Fixed
      (spotted by Thomas A. Lowery <tlowery AT cc3 DOT com>)

0.12	2005-09-28

      (spotted by Darren Duncan)

0.11	2005-09-27

0.09	2004-12-04
    - 0.08 only fixed uniq() for scalar context

0.08	2004-12-03
    - uniq() was not mentioned in the perldocs and only had
      the XS implementation
    - uniq() also produced wrong results on 5.8.0
      (thanks to Slaven Rezic for spotting it and suggesting
      a workaround)
    - the test-suite triggered a bug in 5.6.x perls
    - the test-suite now tests both the XS- and Perl-implementation
    - a wrong example in the perldocs fixed (Ron Savage)
